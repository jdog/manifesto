<h4>The way many people end up writing javascript is messy and confusing</h4>
Web developers who find themselves writing javascript tend to write it as a quick means to an end. The thinking goes like this, <i>what is the fastest way I can get in and then get out of this process so that I can get back to 'X' which I'd much rather be doing</i>. Thinking like this leads to code copied from other sources that does not match the structure needed for the task at hand. Of all things, this is the source of messy and confusing code.

<h4>Code is information and process gathered into a structure</h4>
When you are writing code, you are organizing information. The structure of your organization needs to be readable not just to others, but to yourself. Ideally, it should be organized from the beginning, following a prior pattern which adds readability and fluidity. For once you get into the groove, writing code becomes an expression of the intellect and the soul.

<h4>Good structure makes work a pleasure instead of a task</h4>
The human mind like any logic processor yearns for good organization. When you enter a clean kitchen, with good seperation of utensils, consistent and easily accessible access to pans, oil, eggs, towels, the task of cooking becomes a pleasure. Instead of struggling over the layout of the kitchen, you focus on the quality of the food.

Now imagine a kitchen where the towels are dirty, with some on the floor, and other clean towels mixed in. Spoons are in this drawer, but forks take a stool to reach. Or imagine if there are no fresh eggs, or the burner only works on Tuesdays if you whack it just right. Even if you want to cook you will need to clean it up a little bit. But if you clean up too much you'd be too hungry and frustrated. So instead, you half clean the place, working around the problems, leaving the mess for the next time you cook. That pretty well describes the state of web development in many shops.

<h4>Frustration leads to resistence to learn better ways</h4>
Imagine always having to face that gruelling task of a messy kitchen. Would you be excited to cook, or more excited to order out?

Developers who face the code equivalent of the messy kitchen often cringe because the've developed a visceral dislike of the javascript language due to their own experience with poorly organized and overlly complicated code. Having no yearning to learn better ways of working with it, developers resort to quick copy paste hacks. Banging on it till it stops breaking. If you are one of these engineers, my heart goes out to you. I've been there too, many of us have. But there is a better way. 

<h4>JavaScript is a good and versitile language, and it's here to stay</h4>
Though there is an easy argument that it doesn't deserve to be, English is the dominant language on earth. As a language it's not all bad. Spelling of words is kinda crazy, but it's highly adaptable for new words, syntax, grammer, and fairly easy to learn, plus it already has a huge market share. English is here to stay. 

Javascript is the most widely used computer language on earth; running natively on more devices than any other. If you write code for websites then you need to learn how to write good javascript.

<h4>JavaScript is the easiest language to learn</h4>
Because it runs on more devices than any other language, and because it does not need to be compiled first, it is a trivial matter to test code in a web browser. All the major browser have a web consoleto type in code and see what returns. Further, there are many great resources to learn the language, by many different writers with many different styles. More get added by the hour.

<h4>Easy to learn, easy to write, but that does not make everyone Shakespeare</h4>
Not everyone can be as prolific as Shakespeare, or Stephen King. Sometimes the hardest thing to do is organize your thoughts into a conveyable form. Often when I write code, much as a writer writing a play or book, you end up erasing nearly everything and starting over. Or cutting 5 lines of code into a simple one line if statement. Good writers know that it can take many drafts of working a problem to arrive at a solution that is worth anything. It is the process of editing that improves the writing for the next time. You'll never get better until you try.

<h4>It's time to start writing javascript with integrity, purpose, and with structure</h4>
It can be argued that the old days of the web had little use for javascript, but that has not been true for years now. It's time to treat the language itself with respect. So many times I hear people starting out with javaScript discount it based on the opinion of some blogger.

<h4>What is jDog</h4>
jDog is a javascript library to organize and structure your scripts, giving easy access from within the web console and within your code. It is also a pattern for developing code with good structure easily and consistently. And because it's been around awhile, it is also a growing body of scripts which interact with each other consistently and reliably allowing you to build out robust new code. It's a small library, much smaller than require.js, while bigger than include.js. Still, the main benefit is the structure it provides. It interacts well with other libraries, has it's own integrated testing framework. No fancy stuff, just good vanilla javaScript doing important things to help you out.  <a href="api.html">Complete API Here</a>
