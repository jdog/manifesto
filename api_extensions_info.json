				"jDog is a javascript library to organize and structure your scripts, giving easy access from within the web console and within your code to the global variable PAGE. It is also a pattern for developing code with good structure easily and consistently. It is also a growing body of scripts which interact with each other consistently and reliably allowing you to build out robust new code."
				, "page.loader.js is the first file to load for all other jDog scripts to work correctly. It must load before 'Base' and all other extensions. By design it is very small, when minified, it's extremely small and can be added inline into the page HTML itself."
